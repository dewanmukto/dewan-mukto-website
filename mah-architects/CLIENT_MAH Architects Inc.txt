Insights

Why your project requires architects?

The Architect, who functions as advisor, coordinator, and technical manager, in addition to being a creative artist, can design and administer a contract that ensures a project is completed on time, within budget, and meets the required standards of quality.
According to Ontario jurisdiction by law, certain types of projects must involve an architect to ensure public health, safety, welfare, sustainable growth, and environmental protection. When determining if your project requires architectural services, hiring a qualified architect can be beneficial. Architects have expertise in built environments and are knowledgeable about complex regulatory requirements such as building codes, zoning bylaws, the construction process, and environmental considerations.
